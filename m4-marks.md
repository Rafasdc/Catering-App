# Marking Guide    / 40

# Interim Mark 22/25
# Product Requirements 5/5 
This is about meeting the requirements identified in the problem statement. 

- send email and random name API ++

# Product Quality 5/5
This is about the content of the pitch.

- The demo was good. I would just start with the product next time. Use the slides as backup, or have a script to say "here's the order of the walkthru".
- Be careful how much of the Django builtin modules you claim as your own.

# Technical Briefing 8/10
This is about the content of the technical portion of the pitch. Every team member should expect to be asked about the technical details of the project. Sample question: "how is this controller wired to this view".

- the brief demonstrated a solid understanding of Django. Kyle's walkthru was convincing. 
- I was not entirely convinced by the separate implementation of manager/admin. Is it practical to expect each company to install Django Admin on their machines?
- the local install was a limit. I think you could have spent time onboarding Mohannad, or integrating CI tools, instead of a bit of goldplating with temp employees. But this is nitpicking.

# Presentation "Pitch" Marks 4/5
This is about the professionalism and presentation of your pitch and tech brief.

- see above. It was a tad long-winded. Some hiccups with how to present. Consider closing everything on screen but the apps you need for the demo. 

# Code and Design Quality /15
Note that you have until Friday before the code quality gets marked. NB: Many of the items here can be 'tested' with BetterCodeHub. In other words, a low BCH score will be a negative signal for me about this aspect.

- clarity and maintainability of the code (organization, packaging, class size)
- documentation is useful and present throughout
- code has unit tests
- code shows evidence of design principles such as SOLID, Design Patterns used where appropriate
- language and frameworks chosen are used properly (e.g. following Python idioms like list comprehensions)
- no obvious design smells like God Class, lack of refactoring, helpful names

# Bonus 0/12.5 (project: 5%)
- Travis CI, Junit, Docker, etc are used in meaningful way (integral part of development process)
