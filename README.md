The CodeCatz project is created with the django web framework

# To start

You must create your own super user, and populate your own database. Always remember to migrate models. 

# Auto-population
For auto-population of databases, run python manage.py populate_db. To add items to populate_db, load catering/management/commands/populate_db.py and edit it and add what you think is important. There is an example showcasing the syntax, add a function for the model you're populating.
